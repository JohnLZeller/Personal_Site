Writing software someone is going to directly benefit from is as exciting as any job that I can think of. My goals are to work with a company that isn't just holding the line, but is pushing the edge of what is out there. I seek to make an impact on my community and my planet, in a positive and uplifting way through the power of software.</p></div>
