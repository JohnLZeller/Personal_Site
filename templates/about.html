	<p>You know, the more I write software, the more I realize what drives me and sustains my interest in this profession; and it's the people. Writing software someone is going to directly benefit from is as exciting as any job that I can think of. My goals are to work with a company that isn't just holding the line, but is pushing the edge of what is out there. I seek to make an impact on my community and my planet, in a positive and uplifting way through the power of software.</p>
